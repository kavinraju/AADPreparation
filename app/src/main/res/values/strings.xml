    <string name="big_text_notification">If an app registers to receive broadcasts, the app\'s receiver consumes resources every time the broadcast is sent. This can cause problems if too many apps register to receive broadcasts based on system events; a system event that triggers a broadcast can cause all of those apps to consume resources in rapid succession, impairing the user experience. To mitigate this problem, Android 7.0 (API level 24) placed limitations on broadcasts, as described in Background Optimization. Android 8.0 (API level 26) makes these limitations more stringent.</string>
